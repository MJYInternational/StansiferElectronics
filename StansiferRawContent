Established in 1946, Stansifer Electronics has now served the city of Bloomington and surrounding areas for 72 years. 
Earl (Ted) Stansifer started the business in his home on Rogers St. (Prospect Hill) in 1944 before moving to its current location on South Walnut in 1955. The Store remains family owned by Ted’s Daughter Wanda Stansifer Smith, and operated by her son David Smith (Stansifer’s VP of Sales).
